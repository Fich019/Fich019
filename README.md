Hi, I’m @Fich019 but you can call me Zack. I am a BSc Computing and Games Development student graduating from Plymouth University in 2021. My interests and passon lies in 
programming, specifically within the Games and Games Development areas. I do also enjoy the wider computing industry, the internal workings of a computer as well as other 
aspects of the industry that aren't related to coding. I enjoy understanding the mechanics behind games as I enjoy knowing how the game was created as much as I enjoy 
playing them.

I am currently looking for a Software Engineer / Developer / Game Developer jobs in C# or C++ specifically but I am willing to exand into more languages as well!
